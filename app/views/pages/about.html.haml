		The University of Toronto Ironsports Club (UTIS) is non-profit student powerlifting community.  Founded in March 2012 by Amanda Santos and James Cash, U of T Ironsports was created to connect student powerlifters to training and nutrition resources as well as each other. Students are often seeking healthy methods of stress relief and support networks, both of which U of T Ironsports aims to provide.

	%h3 Why Powerlifting?

	%blockquote
		"The Iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential, it’s impossible to turn back. The Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you’re a god or a total bastard. The Iron will always kick you the real deal. The Iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver. Always there like a beacon in the pitch black. I have found the Iron to be my greatest friend. It never freaks out on me, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds." - Excerpt from

		Powerlifting is a very accessible sport that can be practiced by participants of any age, body-type, and athletic background. Power-training is a key component in many other types of sports-specific training and, as such, U of T Ironsports athletes can excel with other sports teams simultaneously. While group training sessions will be offered and encouraged, U of T Ironsports members are able to train at a time most convenient to them.
